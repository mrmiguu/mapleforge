Genesis 3:15

I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and
her offspring. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel.

Daniel 7:13-14

I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the sky
one like a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought
him near before him. Dominion was given him, and glory, and a kingdom, that all
the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an
everlasting dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom one that which
will not be destroyed.

Isaiah 7:14

Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will
conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

Isaiah 9:6

For a child is born to us. A son is given to us; and the government will be on
his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

Psalm 82:8

Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.

Joel 2:28

It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; and your
sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams. Your
young men will see visions.

Isaiah 53

Who has believed our message? To whom has Yahweh’s arm been revealed? For he
grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground. He has no
good looks or majesty. When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire
him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of suffering and acquainted with
disease. He was despised as one from whom men hide their face; and we didn’t
respect him.

Surely he has borne our sickness and carried our suffering; yet we considered
him plagued, struck by God, and afflicted. But he was pierced for our
transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought
our peace was on him; and by his wounds we are healed. All we like sheep have
gone astray. Everyone has turned to his own way; and Yahweh has laid on him the
iniquity of us all.

He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he didn’t open his mouth. As a lamb
that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
so he didn’t open his mouth. He was taken away by oppression and judgment. As
for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the
living and stricken for the disobedience of my people? They made his grave with
the wicked, and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence,
nor was any deceit in his mouth.

Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him. He has caused him to suffer. When you make
his soul an offering for sin, he will see his offspring. He will prolong his
days and Yahweh’s pleasure will prosper in his hand. After the suffering of his
soul, he will see the light and be satisfied. My righteous servant will justify
many by the knowledge of himself; and he will bear their iniquities. Therefore I
will give him a portion with the great. He will divide the plunder with the
strong; because he poured out his soul to death and was counted with the
transgressors; yet he bore the sins of many and made intercession for the
transgressors.

Isaiah 40:3-5

The voice of one who calls out, "Prepare the way of Yahweh in the wilderness!
Make a level highway in the desert for our God. Every valley shall be exalted,
and every mountain and hill shall be made low. The uneven shall be made level,
and the rough places a plain. Yahweh’s glory shall be revealed, and all flesh
shall see it together; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it."

John 1:29

The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God,
who takes away the sin of the world!"

John 3:16

For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.

John 19:28-30

After this, Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished, that the Scripture
might be fulfilled, said, "I am thirsty." Now a vessel full of vinegar was set
there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his
mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished."
Then he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
